scikit-learn, XGBoost,TensorFlow, KerasTuner, Hyperopt

	  -  Built data pipeline to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms
	  -  Tried out various Machine Learning models to shortlist three promising models: MLP, Random Forest, and XGBoost
	  -  Fine-tuned the three models using Byesian optimization
	  -  Ensemble the predictions of these three models by soft voting
